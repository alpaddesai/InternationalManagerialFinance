The S&amp;P index is a good predictor for the rate of return and volatility on Apple stock. The capital structure contains negligible long term debt which reduces the volatility of cash flows.  The sales to asset turn over ratio is close to 1 indicating an excellent utilization of existing assets to generate revenue. Despite the 28.52% dividend payout ratio the earnings per share for common stock is $6.32 and price per earnings ratio is in the range of 18 and 19. The capital structure of the company is positioned to be very capable of making investments for future research and development costs organically and through acquisitions.                                                                                                                               The rudiments of a financial analysis for merger with Apple and Pioneer Corporation. A Japanese based public company Pioneer Corporation has been selected due to possible synergies in the car and home electronics business with Apple products. The valuation is my opinion based on available financial data   from last year. It does not contain any company confidential information. Entity valuations are consistent with the existing market price of Apple stock with assumptions on the terminal value and growth rates for revenue. Utilizing historical values for the capital asset pricing model to calculate the discount ratio. Keeping the capital structure of the firm constant and utilizing an adjusted present valuation method the unleveraged entity valuation of Apple is $662,516 million, with tax shields of $12,139 million the total entity valuation is $674,555 million which calculates to $112 price per share with the existing # of outstanding shares.  For Pioneer the market premium of 6.73% is relative to the Japanese government a discount ratio of 13.95% is calculated.  The unleveraged valuation is ¥123,488.3 with tax shields of ¥17,550.4, equating to a total entity valuation of ¥141,038.7 and hence ¥343.0 for price of stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Basic synergies of a subsidiary vertical merger, target valuation, negotiations, financial transaction analysis.Estimating a net operating profit after taxes increase of 1.5% in the combined firm due to increase in market share, new product mix and increased sales distribution channels Operational synergies can be achieved through economies of scale and scope by utilizing increased manufacturing facilities within Asia.  Possible financial synergies can be achieved through global markets. The discount ratio utilized for the valuation of the combined firm with synergies is that of the buyer corporation. With that in consideration the target valuation would be higher than market value due to a negotiated 30-40% increase in target valuation due to synergies with projected synergies of approximately $10 billion. To keep the analysis simple, the transaction would be cash for Pioneer stock at the price of $13.3 or ¥1,5815 per stock and this includes a 30% control premium. The target valuation is ¥595,820.4 or $5.004 billion and 5.9x the current market capitalization value of Pioneer.   The price of Apple stock is expected to increase from $112.13 to $116.73 post merger. Tax implications, complex payment methods, global corporate governance implications, accounting aspects, merging financial statements, Legal implications, global market volatility, operational and organizational integration, marketing and sales strategic modifications amongst other various factors would also be taken into consideration for a more thorough analysis."
